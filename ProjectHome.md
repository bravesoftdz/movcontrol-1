movControl is a Delphi VCL component. It allows customizing the GUI (the position and dimension of GUI controls), during execution, by final users. Versions are available for Delphi 5, 7 and 2005 for Win32 target platform.
The programer, component user, must place it on the Delphi form and make some settings with the Object Inspector. At the application execution, the end user will be able to move or re-size the components of this sheet as desired.

**See the wiki for more details and the roadmap of the evolution.**
