# Introduction #

The goal of movControl is to provide capability to customize the GUI, at run-time, by final user. The programer needs only placing on form who needs be customized, the movControl component. After that, some movControl parameters, must be set. Those parameters are published properties of the component.

Gradually as the versions of movControl increment, new capabilities will be added to this component and necessarily new properties would be published or added. This document is the roadmap of movControl project evolution. You will find the features offered by this component in the current version (marked **"current"**), past or future.
